# warp-kiosk
Warp Kiosk is a Flask application designed for Raspberry Pi, functioning as an interactive kiosk to display customer profiles. Users can add a Line bot via a QR code to share their profile data, which includes photos, captions, and social media links. This data is stored in a SQLite database and displayed in a looping slideshow.
